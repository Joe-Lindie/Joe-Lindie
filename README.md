## **About Me 🤷‍♂️** <br>
Hi, I'm Joe **(he/him)**. I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a background in Railway Infrastructure. I am currently on the [Founders & Coders Programme](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/). Railway Infrastructure to Software Engineer, you may ask? My newfound passion for programming started when I wanted to build a website to host my content 📸. (You can see my photography [here](https://joe-lindie.github.io/Bindus-Photography/).) Since then, I have continued to learn. I'm building a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I attend weekly meetups at [Codebar](https://codebar.io/) and hone my new skills through FreeCodeCamp, Execute Programme and hundreds of hours of practice.
